Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was using a list and importing the data in a way that would reflect in a numerical value for the customer Corner Grocer. It analyzed the text records and provided the user an output by a specific word searched. 

What did you do particularly well?
I think I did the best at setting up the data and setting up the classes to pull that information over into my .cpp file. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code heavily all over. I am really struggling with c++. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found the histogram the most challenging to write, being that I struggle with basic printing skills. I am worried to add in any sort of character beyond what is necessary. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think the skills from this project that would be transferable to other projects is the ability to follow along with what is being asked and execute that line by line with code, with the ability to break the project into smaller chunks to understand the larger picture/goal. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I use the build and run with debugging option often to ensure there are no errors, or point me in the direction of where my error is. A tutor also taught me about toe GDB online debugger, and I found that extremely helpful for when I was trying to build simple programs.
